# Cybersecurity Fundamentals

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

### 2. The CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- **Integrity**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information
- **Availability**: Ensuring authorized users have reliable access to information

### 3. Security vs Compliance
- **Security**: Actual protection measures
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements (often a subset of security)

### 4. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls (physical, technical, administrative) to protect valuable information.

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Least Privilege**: Users should have minimum necessary permissions
2. **Separation of Duties**: No single individual controls all aspects
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
4. **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Default to secure settings
5. **Economy of Mechanism**: Keep security simple and verifiable
