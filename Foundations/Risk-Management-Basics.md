### 2. Risk Assessment
**Qualitative vs Quantitative:**
- Qualitative: High/Medium/Low ratings
- Quantitative: Monetary values, probabilities

**Risk Matrix:**
```markdown
| Probability | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| High        | Medium     | High          | Critical    |
| Medium      | Low        | Medium        | High        |
